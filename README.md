# LTRANSv.2b
Larval TRANSport Lagrangian model is an off-line particle-tracking model that is forced with Regional Ocean Modeling System (ROMS) results.

The code was originally released here:
http://northweb.hpl.umces.edu/LTRANS.htm

Code in the LTRANS GitHub organization is based off of code developed by Elizabeth North, Zachary Schlag, and Ian Mitchell with input from Chris Sherwood and Scott Peckham.
